# Image Duplication

This was a very stupid project I did, to really destroy all my storage

To actually use this, change the `source` line file path, to the one you want to copy.

## Idea

This idea was from my friend, as he wrote it in python, i natually decided to have any strokes with C, and how hard it is to type. But, the reason I wanted to write it in C was because of how fast it is.
